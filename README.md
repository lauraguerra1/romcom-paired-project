# RomCom  

### Abstract:
This application randomly renerates classical romantic comedy book covers with titles and taglines. Users are also able to create their own unique book cover by entering custom descriptors. Lastly, users are able to save preferred covers, view a display of all saved covers, and delete undesired covers. This app can be used to help writers overcome creative blocks by generating new story ideas based off of a cover image, title, and tagline.

### Learning Goals:
- Build functionality using functions that follow the Single Responsibility Principle. 
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM. 
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used.

### Wins + Challenges:
- *Biggest challenge*: <br>
During iteration 1, we had issues getting started as we lacked an understanding of the classList object. Once we learned how to invoke the `add()` and `remove()` methods on the `classList` object to hide DOM elements, we were able to move through the remainder of that iteration. 
- *Biggest win*: 
<br>
Once we learned more about the `classList` object, the `className` string, and the relationship between `childNode` and `parentNode` er gained confidence in our skills and were able to progress through the remaining iterations. Additionally, gaining an understanding of the `target` property of DOM elements was useful in idenfying which element an event originated from, and allowed us to complete iteration 4. 
<br>
#### Other wins that were essential to our professional development include: 
1. Completion of our first collaborative project 
2. We originally overestimated the amount of time it would take to complete thr project, and finished ahead of schedule.  
3. We furthered our understanding of the value of stopping work and **identifying unproductive struggle**. This skill allowed us to regroup and make headway when we resturned with fresh eyes and ideas.
